Here, we show that the rupture propagation of simulated slow and fast earthquakes can be predicted by a newly-developed three-dimensional theory of dynamic fracture mechanics accounting for finite rupture width, an essential ingredient missing in previous theories. The complete spectrum of rupture speeds is controlled by the ratio of fracture energy to energy release rate. Shear stress heterogeneity can produce a cubic scaling on a single fault while effective normal stress variability produces a linear scaling on a population of faults, which reconciles the debated scaling relations. This model provides a new framework to explain how slow slip might lead to earthquakes and opens new avenues for seismic hazard assessment integrating seismological, laboratory and theoretical developments.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated rupture mechanics for slow slip events and earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"554b344cd8317a785f95dbc46ddad865","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/zh/publication/12-ng-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/12-ng-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquake rupture speed can affect ground shaking and therefore seismic hazard. Seismological observations show that large earthquakes span a continuum of rupture speeds, from slower than Rayleigh waves up to P-wave speed, and include speeds that are predicted to be unstable by two-dimensional theory. This discrepancy between observations and theory has not yet been reconciled by a quantitative model. Here we present numerical simulations that show that long ruptures with oblique slip (both strike-slip and dip-slip components) can propagate steadily at various speeds, including those previously suggested to be unstable. The obliqueness of slip and the ratio of fracture energy to static energy release rate primarily control the propagation speed of long ruptures. We find that the effects of these controls on rupture speed can be predicted by extending the three-dimensional theory of fracture mechanics to long ruptures with oblique slip. This model advances our ability to interpret supershear earthquakes, to constrain the energy ratio of faults based on observed rupture speed and rake angle, and to relate the potential rupture speed and size of future earthquakes to the observed slip deficit along faults.","tags":null,"title":"Continuum of earthquake rupture speeds enabled by oblique slip","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elif Oral","Huihui Weng","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578018237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1578018237,"objectID":"94a4b97f3832a4d63af03c5f28401a65","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/zh/publication/11-grl-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/11-grl-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Earthquakes are produced by slippage quickly unzipping along faults, causing Earth's vibrations, that is, ground shaking. The impact of the earthquake can become more catastrophic by triggered phenomena, like landslides and tsunamis, as witnessed during the 2018 Palu (Indonesia) earthquake of magnitude 7.5. Generally, the faster the earthquake rupture, the stronger the shaking. The Palu earthquake is among a class of very fast but rare earthquakes whose speed exceeds that of shearing waves in rocks. Theoretically, these so-called “supershear earthquakes” can propagate steadily only if faster than a speed known as Eshelby's speed. Surprisingly, the Palu earthquake is slower than this limit. How can we explain this unusual speed? Did it affect the triggering of landslides, including submarine landslides that likely contributed to the tsunami? We address these questions through computer simulations, particularly focusing on the possible effect of a “fault damage zone,” a layer of softened rocks surrounding faults and caused by rock fracturing accumulated throughout the past fault activity. We found that, if a damage zone exists around the Palu fault, it can explain the unusual speed of this supershear earthquake and may have had the beneficial effect of reducing the shaking and thus its induced landslide and tsunami hazards in Palu.","tags":null,"title":"Does a damaged fault zone mitigate the near-field impact of supershear earthquakes?

However, an individual earthquake's true rupture potential is challenging, as it depends on more than just a static image of prior locking. Here, we test the determinism of interseismic locking models using spontaneous rupture simulations and the well-resolved processes associated with the 2012 moment magnitude (Mw) 7.6 Nicoya earthquake. To do so, we estimate initial megathrust stress from locking by assuming that the entire slip deficit will be released in the next megathrust earthquake. Then we initiate spontaneous ruptures at the hypocenter of the 2012 Nicoya earthquake. We find scenarios that approximate the same coseismic slip distribution and final earthquake moment magnitude as obtained from seismic and geodetic observations, demonstrating that deriving potential rupture scenarios from interseismic locking is feasible. We also find that spontaneous rupture scenarios from different locking models differ in moment rate duration and thus ground motion prediction, although the final slip distribution and moment magnitude were similar. The results highlight that quantifying rupture scenarios and ground motions from reliable locking models by dynamic rupture simulations can be an effective tool for seismic hazard assessment in subduction zones.","tags":null,"title":"Deriving rupture scenarios from interseismic locking distributions along the subduction megathrust","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Jean-Paul Ampuero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564453437,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1564453437,"objectID":"06461f3f62b46ac7b2e0c869151f1660","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/zh/publication/10-jgr-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/10-jgr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The largest earthquakes propagate laterally after saturating the fault's seismogenic width and reach large length-to-width ratios L/W. Smaller earthquakes can also develop elongated ruptures due to confinement by heterogeneities of initial stresses or material properties. The energetics of such elongated ruptures is radically different from that of conventional circular crack models: they feature width-limited rather than length-dependent energy release rate. However, a synoptic understanding of their dynamics is still missing. Here we combine computational and analytical modeling of long ruptures in three dimension (3D) and 2.5D (width-averaged) to develop a theoretical relation between the evolution of rupture speed and the along-strike distribution of fault stress, fracture energy, and rupture width. We find that the evolution of elongated ruptures in our simulations is well described by the following rupture-tip-equation-of-motion,  equation 1,where Gc is the fracture energy, G0 is the steady state energy release rate, vs is the S wave speed, vr is the rupture speed,  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0002 is the rupture acceleration, and  urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb53646:jgrb53646-math-0003 is a known function of rupture speed. The steady energy release rate is limited by rupture width as G0 = γ∆τ2W/μ, where γ is a geometric factor, ∆τ is the stress drop (spatially smoothed over a length scale smaller than W), and μ is the shear modulus. If Gc is a constant and exactly balanced by G0, the rupture can in principle propagate steadily at any speed. If Gc increases with rupture speed, steady ruptures have a well-defined speed and are stable. When Gc ≠ G0, the rupture acquires an inertial effect: the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion depends explicitly on rupture acceleration. This inertial effect does not exist in the classical theory of dynamic rupture in 2-D unbounded media and in unbounded faults in 3D, but emerges in 2-D bounded media or, as shown here, as a consequence of the finite rupture width in 3D. These findings highlight the essential role of the seismogenic width on rupture dynamics. Based on the rupture-tip-equation-of-motion we define the rupture potential, a function that determines the size of next earthquake, and we propose a conceptual model that helps rationalize one type of “supercycles” observed on segmented faults. More generally, the theory developed here can yield relations between earthquake source properties (final magnitude, moment rate function, radiated energy) and the heterogeneities of stress and strength along the fault, which can then be used to extract statistical information on fault heterogeneity from source time functions of past earthquakes or as physics-based constraints on finite-fault source inversion and on seismic hazard assessment.","tags":null,"title":"The Dynamics of Elongated Earthquake Ruptures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huihui Weng","Hongfeng Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532399037,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1532399037,"objectID":"915097e03cbdf9936c07e5b1e77ae3f4","permalink":"https://huihuiweng.github.io/zh/publication/8-jgr-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-24T10:23:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/8-jgr-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Frictional properties of seismogenic faults play critical roles in earthquake generation and rupture propagation. Although laboratory measurements have well revealed the frictional parameters of a variety of rock samples, those on seismogenic faults remain difficult to determine due to the strong trade-off between critical slip-weakening distance (d0) and strength drop. Here we conduct dynamic rupture simulations to determine the frictional parameters on the fault where the 2015 Mw7.8 Nepal earthquake occurred, with constraints from near-field seismic and geodetic observations, and kinematic source models. By utilizing different trade-off patterns of source parameters and multiple observations for the first time, we can determine the frictional parameters of the seismogenic fault. The best fit dynamic model yields a d0value of ~0.6 m, in contrast to the previous kinematical estimation of ~5 m (Galetzka et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac6383). The average fracture energy of this event is urn:x-wiley:21699313:media:jgrb52922:jgrb52922-math-0001 J/m2. Such approach can be used to determine the frictional parameters on seismogenic faults, which could serve for seismic hazard assessment by predicting ground motion from dynamic rupture simulations.","tags":null,"title":"Constraining frictional properties on fault by dynamic rupture simulations and near-field observation","type":"publication"}]
